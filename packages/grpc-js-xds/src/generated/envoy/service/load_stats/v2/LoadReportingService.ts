   * Advanced API to allow for multi-dimensional load balancing by remote

   * 1, The management server is configured with per cluster/zone/load metric
   * capacity configuration. The capacity configuration definition is
   * outside of the scope of this document.
   * 2. Envoy issues a standard {Stream,Fetch}Endpoints request for the clusters
   * to balance.
   * 
   * Independently, Envoy will initiate a StreamLoadStats bidi stream with a
   * management server:
   * 1. Once a connection establishes, the management server publishes a
   * LoadStatsResponse for all clusters it is interested in learning load
   * stats about.
   * 2. For each cluster, Envoy load balances incoming traffic to upstream hosts
   * based on per-zone weights and/or per-instance weights (if specified)
   * based on intra-zone LbPolicy. This information comes from the above
   * {Stream,Fetch}Endpoints.
   * 3. When upstream hosts reply, they optionally add header <define header
   * name> with ASCII representation of EndpointLoadMetricStats.
   * 4. Envoy aggregates load reports over the period of time given to it in
   * LoadStatsResponse.load_reporting_interval. This includes aggregation
   * stats Envoy maintains by itself (total_requests, rpc_errors etc.) as
   * well as load metrics from upstream hosts.
   * 5. When the timer of load_reporting_interval expires, Envoy sends new
   * LoadStatsRequest filled with load reports for each cluster.
   * 6. The management server uses the load reports from all reported Envoys
   * from around the world, computes global assignment and prepares traffic
   * assignment destined for each zone Envoys are located in. Goto 2.
