 * DNS notation. If the policy needs configuration parameters, it must define a message for its
 * own configuration, which will be stored in the config field. The name of the policy will tell
 * clients which type of message they should expect to see in the config field.
 * 
 * Note that there are cases where it is useful to be able to independently select LB policies
 * for choosing a locality and for choosing an endpoint within that locality. For example, a
 * given deployment may always use the same policy to choose the locality, but for choosing the
 * endpoint within the locality, some clusters may use weighted-round-robin, while others may
 * use some sort of session-based balancing.
 * 
 * This can be accomplished via hierarchical LB policies, where the parent LB policy creates a
 * child LB policy for each locality. For each request, the parent chooses the locality and then
 * delegates to the child policy for that locality to choose the endpoint within the locality.
 * 
 * To facilitate this, the config message for the top-level LB policy may include a field of
 * type LoadBalancingPolicy that specifies the child policy.
