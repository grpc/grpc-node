 * Metadata provides additional inputs to filters based on matched listeners,
 * filter chains, routes and endpoints. It is structured as a map, usually from
 * filter name (in reverse DNS format) to metadata specific to the filter. Metadata
 * key-values for a filter are merged as connection and request handling occurs,
 * with later values for the same key overriding earlier values.
 * 
 * An example use of metadata is providing additional values to
 * http_connection_manager in the envoy.http_connection_manager.access_log
 * namespace.
 * 
 * Another example use of metadata is to per service config info in cluster metadata, which may get
 * consumed by multiple filters.
 * 
 * For load balancing, Metadata provides a means to subset cluster endpoints.
 * Endpoints have a Metadata object associated and routes contain a Metadata
 * object to match against. There are some well defined metadata used today for
 * this purpose:
 * 
 * * ``{"envoy.lb": {"canary": <bool> }}`` This indicates the canary status of an
 * endpoint and is also used during header processing
 * (x-envoy-upstream-canary) and for stats purposes.
