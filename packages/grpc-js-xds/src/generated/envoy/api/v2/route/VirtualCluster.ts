/**
 * A virtual cluster is a way of specifying a regex matching rule against
 * certain important endpoints such that statistics are generated explicitly for
 * the matched requests. The reason this is useful is that when doing
 * prefix/path matching Envoy does not always know what the application
 * considers to be an endpoint. Thus, it’s impossible for Envoy to generically
 * emit per endpoint statistics. However, often systems have highly critical
 * endpoints that they wish to get “perfect” statistics on. Virtual cluster
 * statistics are perfect in the sense that they are emitted on the downstream
 * side such that they include network level failures.
 * 
 * Documentation for :ref:`virtual cluster statistics <config_http_filters_router_vcluster_stats>`.
 * 
 * .. note::
 * 
 * Virtual clusters are a useful tool, but we do not recommend setting up a virtual cluster for
 * every application endpoint. This is both not easily maintainable and as well the matching and
 * statistics output are not free.
