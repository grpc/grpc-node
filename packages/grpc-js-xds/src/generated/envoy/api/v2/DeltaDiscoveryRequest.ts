/**
 * DeltaDiscoveryRequest and DeltaDiscoveryResponse are used in a new gRPC
 * endpoint for Delta xDS.
 * 
 * With Delta xDS, the DeltaDiscoveryResponses do not need to include a full
 * snapshot of the tracked resources. Instead, DeltaDiscoveryResponses are a
 * diff to the state of a xDS client.
 * In Delta XDS there are per-resource versions, which allow tracking state at
 * the resource granularity.
 * An xDS Delta session is always in the context of a gRPC bidirectional
 * stream. This allows the xDS server to keep track of the state of xDS clients
 * connected to it.
 * 
 * In Delta xDS the nonce field is required and used to pair
 * DeltaDiscoveryResponse to a DeltaDiscoveryRequest ACK or NACK.
 * Optionally, a response message level system_version_info is present for
 * debugging purposes only.
 * 
 * DeltaDiscoveryRequest plays two independent roles. Any DeltaDiscoveryRequest
 * can be either or both of: [1] informing the server of what resources the
 * client has gained/lost interest in (using resource_names_subscribe and
 * resource_names_unsubscribe), or [2] (N)ACKing an earlier resource update from
 * the server (using response_nonce, with presence of error_detail making it a NACK).
 * Additionally, the first message (for a given type_url) of a reconnected gRPC stream
 * has a third role: informing the server of the resources (and their versions)
 * that the client already possesses, using the initial_resource_versions field.
 * 
 * As with state-of-the-world, when multiple resource types are multiplexed (ADS),
 * all requests/acknowledgments/updates are logically walled off by type_url:
 * a Cluster ACK exists in a completely separate world from a prior Route NACK.
 * In particular, initial_resource_versions being sent at the "start" of every
 * gRPC stream actually entails a message for each type_url, each with its own
 * initial_resource_versions.
 * [#next-free-field: 8]
